markovgenerator
==============

A Markov text generator written in Python.

The MarkovGenerator class takes a input text to generate sentences from, the length of the output you want (in characters), and an optional ngram length (the default is 2).

Many thanks to @jamak for his help with this!

TODO:
- fix ending punctuation, don't add a period if there's already something (maybe works now)
- figure out what's going on with `` marks
- pickle input?
