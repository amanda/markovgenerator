markovgenerator
==============

A Markov text generator written in Python.

The MarkovGenerator class takes a input text to generate sentences from, the length of the output you want (in characters), and an optional ngram length (default is 2).

To use as is: python markov.py textfile and it spits out a good tweet, but you can use the MarkovGenerator class to generate text of any length.

Many thanks to @jamak for his help with this!
